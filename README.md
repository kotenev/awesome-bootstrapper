## Frontend Development

- [CSS](frontend/css.md): Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

- [Performance](frontend/performance.md): Web performance refers to the speed in which web pages are downloaded and displayed on the user's web browser. Web performance optimization, or website optimization is the field of knowledge about increasing web performance.

- [PWA](frontend/pwa.md): Progressive Web Apps are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications.

- [Vue.js](frontend/vue.md): Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is simplified with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable.

## Mindset

- [Networking](mindset/networking.md): A computer network, or data network, is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections between nodes.

- [TDD](mindset/tdd.md): Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.

## Tooling

- [Git](tooling/git.md): Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.
