# Awesome Bootstrapper

> üë©‚ÄçüöÄüë®‚ÄçüöÄ Must-read articles, videos, books and development tools for bootstrappers.

## Backend Development

- [Sails.js](backend/sails.md): Sails is the most popular MVC framework for Node.js, designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs with a scalable, service-oriented architecture.

## Frontend Development

- [CSS](frontend/css.md): Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

- [Performance](frontend/performance.md): Web performance refers to the speed in which web pages are downloaded and displayed on the user's web browser. Web performance optimization, or website optimization is the field of knowledge about increasing web performance.

- [PWA](frontend/pwa.md): Progressive Web Apps are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications.

- [Vue.js](frontend/vue.md): Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is simplified with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable.

## Languages

- [JavaScript](languages/javascript.md): JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.

## Mindset

- [Networking](mindset/networking.md): A computer network, or data network, is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections between nodes.

- [TDD](mindset/tdd.md): Test-driven development is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.

## Tooling

- [Git](tooling/git.md): Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source-code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

- [Visual Studio Code](tooling/vscode.md): Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
