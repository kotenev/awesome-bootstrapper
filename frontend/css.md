# Mastering CSS

> Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## Code style

- ðŸ“– [Key concepts for BEM syntax](https://en.bem.info/methodology/key-concepts/): BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting.

- ðŸ“– [MindBEMding â€“ getting your head â€™round BEM syntax](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/): One of the questions I get asked most frequently is what do -- and \_\_ mean in your classes?

- ðŸ“– [Naming convention for BEM syntax](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/): Working with BEM entities requires a knowledge of their naming rules.

- ðŸ“– [More Transparent UI Code with Namespaces](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/): When we work at scale, we often find that we spend a large amount of our time reading, maintaining, and refactoring existing code, rather than writing and adding new features. This is the reason we focus so much on things like architectures, naming conventions, methodologies, preprocessors, scalability, etc.: because writing CSS is easy; looking after it is not.

- ðŸ“– [InuitCSS README](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/blob/develop/README.md): inuitcss is a framework in its truest sense: it does not provide you with UI and design out of the box, instead, it provides you with a solid architectural baseline upon which to complete your own work.
